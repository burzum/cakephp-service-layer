# Bake

## Bake your Service

Once the plugin is loaded, you can bake your service using:
```
bin/cake bake service MyFooBar
```
This would create a service class `src/Service/MyFooBarService.php`.

You can also bake inside sub namespaces (subfolders):
```
bin/cake bake service My/Foo/Bar
```
This would create a service class `src/Service/My/Foo/BarService.php`.
